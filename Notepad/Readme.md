Notepad, a simple text editor included in the Microsoft Windows operating system, is designed for basic text editing tasks and doesn't have advanced features like those found in more sophisticated text editors or word processors. Notepad doesn't offer the level of optimization and streamlined text manipulation capabilities that more specialized tools might provide. However, I can provide you with some general insights into how text editors might achieve optimal memory usage and streamlined text manipulation.

1. *Buffer Management*: Text editors often use buffers to store the text being edited. Efficient buffer management is crucial for memory optimization. This involves loading only a portion of the text into memory at a time and dynamically loading more as the user scrolls or navigates through the document.

2. *Lazy Loading*: To conserve memory, a text editor can employ lazy loading, which means loading only the visible portion of the document and loading additional content as the user scrolls or moves the cursor. This approach minimizes the memory footprint while providing a seamless editing experience.

3. *Memory Recycling*: Properly managing memory allocation and recycling is essential. Text editors can reuse memory that is no longer needed, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks and unnecessary memory consumption.

4. *Caching*: Caching frequently accessed data or components can speed up various text manipulation operations. For example, caching the results of syntax highlighting or search results can improve the responsiveness of the text editor.

5. *Text Rendering*: Efficient rendering of text involves optimizing how characters and formatting are displayed on the screen. Using appropriate text rendering libraries and techniques can improve both performance and memory usage.

6. *Multithreading*: For handling large files, multithreading can be employed to distribute text processing tasks across multiple threads or cores, making better use of available resources.

7. *Undo/Redo Management*: Effective undo and redo functionality requires careful management of the changes made to the text and memory allocation for maintaining different versions of the document.

8. *Data Structures*: Utilizing appropriate data structures, such as balanced trees or hash maps, can expedite various text manipulation operations, like searching, replacing, or indexing.

9. *Optimized Algorithms*: Using efficient algorithms for tasks like searching, sorting, and text manipulation can significantly impact the speed and resource utilization of the text editor.

10. *Plugin Architecture*: Some text editors support plugins or extensions that can provide specialized functionalities. These can be optimized for specific tasks while keeping the core editor lightweight.

11. *Code Optimization*: Ensuring that the codebase of the text editor is optimized and follows best practices can contribute to better memory usage and performance.

Please note that while Notepad is a basic text editor, more advanced text editors, integrated development environments (IDEs), and code editors often incorporate many of these techniques to provide a more optimized and feature-rich editing experience. It's also possible that there have been updates to Notepad or new developments in text editing software.
